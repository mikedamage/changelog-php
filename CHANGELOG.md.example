# Bridges Peru Website Changelog

--------------------------------------

Please record all changes to the Bridges website in this document.
This document uses Markdown syntax for text formatting, which allows the Changelog to be converted to HTML for easier viewing without having to worry about all those annoying HTML tags.

A Markdown reference can be found at [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). If you don't feel like learning Markdown, just refer to the changelog format below.

Note that underscores must be escaped with a backslash (like this: "\_"). Otherwise Markdown thinks you're trying to italicize something.

Use the following format for all change records (including the dashes for horizontal rules to seperate each time the site is updated):
